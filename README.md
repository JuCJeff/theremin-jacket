## Changes to our approach

We originally want to design the primitive circuit and sensors to make the sensing work. William has just worked out the sonar in wednesday, and as a backup plan and primitive approach we will design a theremin using the sonar sensors and integrate it as a part of jacket.

In search for potential improvement of gesture recognition, we also focus our attention on Leap Motion. On leap motion, we're able to capture richer and more sensive gesture information â€” able to grab, tremble, drastically move up and down, within its well-defined range of service.

## Development Log

[Cylon.js](https://cylonjs.com/documentation/examples/cylon/annotated/leap_arduino/): an arduino API to control the leap motion

[Adafruit strip LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2824?length=1) : a $17.99 

Leap Motion installation: Trouble shooting in Windows.

Stability and range: Use distant infrared LED to increase light detection stability in distance thus increase range.

Potentially position Leap Motion in one side of chest to achieve proper motion detection

Testing: Can us v from horizontal mode to VR mode

Design idea: infrared light and visible light design and position
